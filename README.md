# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

<img src="examples/laneLines_thirdPass.jpg" width="480" alt="Combined Image" />

Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project lane lines in images are detected using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images. 

The Project Setup
---

**Step 1:** Set up the [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) to run this project. Detailed instructions are provided in the link.

**Step 2:** Open the code in a Jupyter Notebook

  All the code for this project is contained in a Jupyter notebook named "P1.ipynb".   

**Step 3:** Technical details for the project are provided in the PDF "project_writeup_report.pdf"
